This is just a personal hobby I am currently working on, partly to get better at Java and Forge and also learn about farming.


## What is FarmingRi ?
FarmingRi is a Minecraft Forge Mod that aims to rework some vanilla farming mechanics 
and instead provides a more realistic, technological, and sometimes a futuristic and mythical approach like that of modern day farming.

While not trying to be completely realistic, it instead builds on the core concepts used in farming today.

For example, this means instead of using a combine to thresh the wheat, the threshing process can be
placed in a block.

Another example would be creating hay bales. In FarmingRi to create hay bales all you need are the
ingredients and a crafting table, as you can see, this is not very representative of real life, but the
concept is the same.


## Current Notes
 
- Instead of using the built-in recipe manager, I am currently using a Hashmap to store the recipes. This is a temporary solution and I aim to change this as soon as possible.
- There are quite a few blocks that are currently non-functional.
